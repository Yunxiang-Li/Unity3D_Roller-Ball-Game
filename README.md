## Background
This is a very simple 3D roller ball game made by Unity3D according to the [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/)'s coursera course [Introduction to Game Development](https://www-cloudfront-alias.coursera.org/learn/game-development/home/welcome).

This game altogether has 2 levels. For each level, player needs to collect specific amount of coins to win the level, 5 coins need to be collected in level one and 10 coins need to be collected in level two.

Player can press wasd or arrow buttons to move the roller ball, player can also press space button to jump only in level two. There will be enemies spawning and chasing the player(the ball), if player is collided with enemies or death zone or just jumping out of the map, then the player is dead.
